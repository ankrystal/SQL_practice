# Î¨∏Ï†ú 1. Challenges 

Q. Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. <br>
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. <br>
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. <br>
If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. <br>
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.
