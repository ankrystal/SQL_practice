# 문제 2. The Report

Q. Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. <br>
Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. <br>
The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. <br>
If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. <br>
Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. <br>
If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order. <br>
Write a query to help Eve.
