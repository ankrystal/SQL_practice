#### SELF JOIN으로 풀기 
```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs L1 JOIN Logs L2 ON L1.id = L2.id+1 AND L1.num = L2.num
             JOIN Logs L3 ON L1.id = L3.id+2 AND L1.num = L3.num
```

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs L1 JOIN Logs L2 ON L1.id = L2.id+1 
             JOIN Logs L3 ON L1.id = L3.id+2 
WHERE L1.num = L2.num 
  AND L1.num = L3.num
```

#### 윈도우 함수(LEAD) 사용해서 풀기 
```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT L.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
      SELECT num
           , LEAD(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next
           , LEAD(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) as afternext 
      FROM logs) L
WHERE L.num = L.next AND L.num = L.afternext 
```

#### 윈도우 함수(LAG) 사용해서 풀기 
```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT L.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
      SELECT num
           , LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next
           , LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) as afternext 
      FROM logs) L
WHERE L.num = L.next AND L.num = L.afternext 
```
