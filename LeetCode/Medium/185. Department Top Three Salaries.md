🔑 문제 풀이
#### 윈도우 함수(DENSE_RANK) 사용해서 풀기
```mysql
SELECT Department.Name AS 'Department'
     , e.name AS 'Employee'
     , e.salary 
FROM
    (SELECT departmentId
        , name
        , salary
        , DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS r
    FROM Employee) e
JOIN Department ON e.departmentId = Department.id
WHERE r <= 3 
```

#### SUBQUERY로 풀기
```mysql
SELECT d.name Department
     , e.name Employee
     , e.salary Salary
FROM Employee e JOIN Department d 
ON e.departmentId = d.Id
WHERE e.salary IN (
    SELECT * FROM (                  
        SELECT DISTINCT(salary) 
        FROM Employee 
        WHERE departmentId = d.Id 
        ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3
    ) AS _
)
```

#### 💡 IN문 뒤에 SELECT * FROM을 넣은 이유 
- LIMIT을 이용한 서브쿼리는 해당 MySQL 버전에서는 지원하지 않으므로 SELECT * FROM 문을 넣어줌으로써 이를 해결 <br>
<This version of MySQL doesn't yet support 'LIMIT & IN/ALL/ANY/SOME subquery>
