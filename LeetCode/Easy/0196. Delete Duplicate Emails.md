# 문제 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Q. Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. <br>
Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one. <br>
After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. <br>
The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. <br>
The final order of the Person table does not matter.
